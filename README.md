# Zenbus Website
This is the Zenbus Website Read Me file.
This was made to help our collaborators figure out what, and how, to edit.

## Which files can I edit?
index.html
And other files you have created.

## Which files can I NOT edit?
zenbus.css
This is because this is EXTREMELY important to not fucking up anything. 

### How do I add info?

Use the <p>Text Here</p> Tags. This created a paragraph part
Use <br> to add breaks between text. Example:
<p>Welcome to the official Zenbus Website</p>
<br>
<p>Information goes here...</p>

<table>Tags are very important to adding info in a table</table>
